## General Approach

As with all the previous projects, I first created the wireframe, user stories,
and ERD. I decided early to use Postgres database and not MongoDB (nothing
against MongoDB, but I felt this was better suited for a sql database).  From
the ERD, I proceeded to get the basic backend tables generated.

Working with it wireframe and user stories, I then started to get a working
CRUD frontend app ready.  I started with the user functions then proceeded to
the remains entries.

Lastly, I tried to beautify the app.  This turned out to be more work than
anticipated.  I wanted to use handlebars, a date picker, and a dropdown this
time.

## Unsolved Problems or Major Hurdles

No unsolved or known probles.  The only major hurdle was trying to remember
rails after working with express.
